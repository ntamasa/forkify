## Project Overview

This website serves as a practice project to reinforce web development concepts learned in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. The site is designed to be purely representational, showcasing various web design techniques, styles, and JavaScript functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content on the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive functionality to the web pages.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ntamasa/forkity.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. **Open the project in your favorite code editor**.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

### Development

For making changes and developing the site further, you can use the following commands:

1. **Install Sass**:
    If you haven't already, you can install Sass using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g sass
    ```

2. **Compile Sass to CSS**:
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    sass --watch scss:css
    ```

## Future Updates

There may be updates and new features added to this project in the future as I continue to learn and apply new concepts. Stay tuned for more enhancements!
